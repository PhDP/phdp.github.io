<p>This short text explains the basic idea behind deep
transfer learning, an ambitious attempt to build machine learning algorithms
capable of exploiting prior knowledge. If you're looking for a technical
treatment, I highly suggest Mihalkova's <a href="http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.119.241&rep=rep1&typ
e=pdf">Mapping and Revising Markov Logic Networks for Transfer Learning</a>,
one of the best algorithm for deep transfer. Also, I do not dwell on
the distinctions between deep and shallow transfer, and the various subtypes
of machine learning algorithms (supervised vs nonsupervised, online vs
batch): I want to provide a strategic overview of what deep transfer learning
is about and why it's important.</p>

<h2>The standard approach to machine learning</h2>

<p>Machine learning is straightforward: data is fed to an algorithm that
builds a model and, hopefully, generate good predictions:</p>

<div class="imagecenter">

</div>

<p>The data can be pretty much anything from ecological data to movie
preferences. Machine learning algorithms can build effective models because
they are tailored for the input data. It is hard, if not impossible, to
build by hand the right mathematical model to solve complex problems such as
handwriting recognition, spam detection, language processing and many, many,
other problems where no simple equation can be found. In these cases, we
have to step back and, instead of focusing on building the model ourselves,
we design algorithms to do it in our place. That's the essence of machine
learning. This approach has been incredibly powerful to solve a wide array
of difficult problems in pretty much all fields of inquiry: it's the <a href="http://www.csee.wvu.edu/~gidoretto/courses/2011-fall-cp/reading/TheUnreasonable%20EffectivenessofData_IEEE_IS2009.pdf">
unreasonable effectiveness of data.</a></p>

<p>Building models this way is good, but it has a few problems. What can we
do when we have little data? If the situation has changed since we collected
our data, is our model still good? When we face a similar situation, can we
reuse our previous model or do we need to build a new one?</p>

<h2>Deep transfer learning algorithms</h2>

<p>Machine learning algorithms use a <i>Tabula rasa</i> approach: the
algorithms start with nothing and build the model only with the supplied
data. It's simple, but it's also inefficient. Deep transfer learning is
about transferring knowledge between different tasks. Instead of starting
from scratch, deep transfer algorithms can exploit accumulated knowledge to
learn faster (we also have good reasons to think deep transfer is a key
component to build reliable models, but that's a more complicated topic). It
looks like this:</p>

<div class="imagecenter">
  <img src="../images/ml-transfer-900.png" alt="Deep transfer learning">
</div>

<p>The algorithm, instead of simply reading the input data, will exploit
data from a large data-set of prior knowledge. This, in itself, is tricky.
The algorithm must make a judgment call: what is relevant to the present
subject, what can be used, and what should be discarded? Certainly, our
model for US presidential elections will be awful if we try, say, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redskins_Rule">to bring data from football
games</a>. So there are risks to deep transfer learning, but the benefits
are huge.</p>

<p>To make an analogy with human learning, imagine you need to learn to run.
Of course, running is very similar to walking so you won't start from zero.
You're able to see that running and walking are similar tasks and thus you
can transfer your knowledge of walking into running. It allows you to learn
much faster, and also yield interesting information on how the two tasks are
related to each other. If you need to learn Mandarin though, running and
walking won't serve you. It's a more general approach: a very conservative
deep transfer learning algorithm could choose to always reject prior
information and would build the model just as before.</p>

<p>Machine learning starts from 0. Big data is nice, but it would be
much nicer if we could build models with more than a tiny fraction of it.
Deep transfer is about determining what is relevant in previous data-sets
and use this information to design better models, and faster! My thesis
focuses on doing just that, using the complex heterogeneous data-sets
found in ecology.</p>
