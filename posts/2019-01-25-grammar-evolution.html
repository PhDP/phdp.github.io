<p>Let's say we want to learn a mathematical formula to perform some task. We could turn to genetic algorithms,
techniques inspired by biological evolution where a population of solutions is subjected to selection, mutations, and
crossovers. The idea is simple: we start with a set of potential solutions (our candidate mathematical formulas),
"mutate" them to explore the solution space, and then select the best to sire a new generation of solutions. Rinse and
repeat until either a good enough solution is found, or you're tired of waiting. There are quite a few variations
on that theme, but it's the gist of it.</p>

<p>The quibble here is, well, how do we mutate a mathematical formula? How do we ensure that the new formulas generated
are valid? I wanted to write a brief post to highlight how grammatical evolution can be used to evolve mathematical
formulas (and programs, and lots of things). Grammatical evolution strikes me as a ludicrously general, elegant idea to
handle the evolution of complex formulas juggling inputs of various types. It also has a nontrivial flaw that will be
described at the end of the post. Take it as a fun little idea to keep in your A.I. toolbox.</p>

<p>To evolve mathematical formulas, we need a way to represent the formulas (our solutions) in such a way that valid
variants are simple to generate. In particular, a key idea in genetic algorithms is that we generate new solutions by
"mixing the genomes", so to speak, of fit parents from the previous generation. But how? A mathematical expression is a
tree, how do you mix trees? How do we ensure the expressions don't grow too big? One approach involves putting the
mathematical formula on a grid (<a href="https://link.springer.com/book/10.1007/978-3-642-17310-3">i.e. Cartesian
genetic programming</a>), which is arguably more effective than the method described here, but for now we'll explore
how to generate expressions from grammars. Here's a simple grammar for digits:</p>

<pre id="plain">&lt;digit&gt; ::= 0 | 1 | 2 | 3 | 4 | 5 | 6 | 7 | 8 | 9</pre>

<p>&lt;digit&gt; is a production rule, they'll always be enclosed within angle brackets. After ::= ("is defined as"),
we get the definition of the production rule as a set of alternatives separated by disjunctions "|". Thus, a digit is
defined as 0, or 1, or 2, or 3, etc. By the by, this format for grammars is called the Backus–Naur form (BNF). It gets
interesting when production rules refer to other production rules, so here's a more interesting grammar describing a
mathematical formula with inputs x and y inside a C function:</p>

<pre id="plain">&lt;cfun&gt; ::= double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;expr&gt;; }
&lt;expr&gt; ::= &lt;expr&gt; &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;
         | &lt;pre&gt;&lt;expr&gt;
         | &lt;fun1&gt;(&lt;expr&gt;)
         | &lt;fun2&gt;(&lt;expr&gt;, &lt;expr&gt;)
         | &lt;var&gt;
&lt;op&gt;   ::= + | - | / | *
&lt;pre&gt;  ::= -
&lt;fun1&gt; ::= sin | cos | tan
&lt;fun2&gt; ::= fmod
&lt;var&gt;  ::= x | y
</pre>

<p>This grammar has seven production rule and can generate strings such as:</p>

<pre id="plain">double please_work(double x, double y) { return -sin(x) + y; }</pre>

<p>Of course, the grammar can generate many other strings, not just this one. A particular string can be seen as a
series of choices among alternatives. Let's say I were to give you the following sequence of integers: [10, 1, 2, 6, 9,
4, 0, 4, 7] and tell you to start at the first production rule &lt;cfun&gt; and use this sequence of integers to select
alternatives. The alternatives use zero-based indexing and if the integer is bigger than the number of alternatives for
a production rule, just apply a modulo (made simpler by zero-based indexing). For example, with &lt;fun1&gt; and the
number 2, we'd get "tan", with &lt;var&gt; and 7 we get "y", with &lt;expr&gt; and 2 we get &lt;pre-op&gt;&lt;expr&gt;.
If there's only one alternative, we do not need to consume an integer from the sequence. Let's see where [10, 1, 2, 6,
9, 4, 0, 4, 7] leads us. We begin with</p>

<pre id="plain">double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;expr&gt;; }</pre>

<p>and use the number 10 to select among &lt;expr&gt;. There are five alternatives, 10 mod 5 = 0, thus:</p>

<pre id="plain">double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;expr&gt; &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }</pre>

<p>We then have to select among &lt;expr&gt; again and our next integer is 1:</p>

<pre id="plain">double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;pre&gt;&lt;expr&gt &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }</pre>

<p>There's only one &lt;pre&gt;, thus our next integer, 2, is used to generates &lt;fun1&gt;(&lt;expr&gt;) from
&lt;expr&gt. 6 is used to select "sin" from &lt;fun1&gt;, and so on and so forth. From the beginning, the sequence [10,
1, 2, 6, 9, 4, 0, 4, 7] applied to our little grammar generates:

<pre id="plain">double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;expr&gt; &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;pre&gt;&lt;expr&gt &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return -&lt;fun1&gt;(&lt;expr&gt;) &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return -sin(&lt;expr&gt;) &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return -sin(&lt;var&gt;) &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return -sin(x) &lt;op&gt; &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return -sin(x) + &lt;expr&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return -sin(x) + &lt;var&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return -sin(x) + y; }
</pre>

<p>Depending on the grammar, it may be common to run out of integers. A partial solution is to allow the sequence to
wrap, so when the end of the sequence is reached we go back to the beginning. When wrapping is allowed, it can only be
done a (generally small) number of times. The other solution is to simply not return anything, essentially killing
sequences that fail to finish an expression. The finite length of the sequence gives some control over how complex the
resulting expression can be. The grammar used as an example here is a bit extreme, it would often run out of integers
because of the way &lt;expr&gt; just creates more &lt;expr&gt; for all but one alternatives, and wrapping won't save us
from this fundamental issue.</p>

<p>The advantage of generating strings from a grammar and a sequence of integers is twofold. Primo, it's easy to ensure
the validity of expressions even in the presence of different types of input. Secondo, we can mutate the expressions
simply by changing an integer, and generate children from parents by mixing their sequence of integers. So I guess
it's Mission Accomplished! We have a flexible method to generate C functions, assembly code, sentences in Cebuano,
mathematical formulas... Well, not quite. The non-probabilistic nature of the grammar can be an issue, we may want some
alternatives to be more common than others, although it is something better learned at runtime than hardwired in the
grammar. A more serious issue is lack of locality. In our previous sequence, if we were to change the 10 by a 9,
we'd get</p>

<pre id="plain">double please_work(double x, double y) { return &lt;var&gt;; }
double please_work(double x, double y) { return y; }</pre>

<p>That's a rather different formula. By locality, we mean we'd like similar sequences of integers to map to similar
formulas (or whatever you're generating). This way, small changes to the sequence would yield different, but similar
formulas, and greater changes would yield more distinct formulas. <a href="https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/11729976_29">Good locality has a measurable effect on the performance
of genetic algorithms, and grammatical evolution tends to suffer from poor locality</a>. To get an intuition of why
this is an issue, just imagine a representation with no locality at all, such that the probability of reaching a given
formula is the same regardless of your starting point. In this world, selecting better and better formulas and applying
mutations to them would be useless, there would be no advantage to mutating a fit formula over an unfit formula if
mutations send it all over the place. Different approaches like Cartesian genetic programming are less affected by this
issue. Nevertheless, grammatical evolution is a fun little idea that may come in handy.</p>
